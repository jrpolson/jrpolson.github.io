    <h3>Welcome to My Website!</h3>
    <article class="widthintro">
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Jessie Polson, and I am currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison earning a bachelor's degree in Journalism with a focus on Strategic Communications and Information Science. I am from a small town in New Jersey and hope to work in New York City or Chicago after graduation in May 2026 in the field of UX Design or creative strategy. However, one of my biggest passions is food, and one of my favorite hobbies is to cook and try new and easy healthy (ish) recipes! So, I wanted to create this website as one place to share and put all of my knowledge about food, coffee (I am a part-time barista), cooking, and more.
