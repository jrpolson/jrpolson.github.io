        <h3>Favorite Coffee Shops in Madison, WI</h3>
        <p>
          Before I became a barista myself, I chronically got a latte without fail almost every day here at school, 
          so I wanted to talk about some of my favorite coffee shops in Madison. Here are my top 5:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Indie Coffee</li>
          <li>Wonderstate Coffee</li>
          <li>Colectivo Coffee</li>
          <li>Valentia Coffee</li>
          <li>Barriques</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Because I loved Indie Coffee so much, I started to work there as a barista, and got an espresso machine 
          to start making my coffees at home. Below I will share my favorite hot and iced latte recipes with instructions:
        </p>

        <h3>Salted Vanilla Honey Cinnamon Hot Latte</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>Ingredients</dt>
          <dd>- Sea salt</dd>
          <dd>- 1 pump vanilla syrup or vanilla bean paste</dd>
          <dd>- 1/2–1 teaspoon honey</dd>
          <dd>- Dash of cinnamon</dd>
          <dd>- 18 g freshly ground espresso beans</dd>
          <dd>- Milk of your choice (I use 2%).</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Process</dt>
          <dd>- Brew your fresh espresso over sea salt, vanilla, honey, and cinnamon. It should take 18–24 seconds to brew if correct. Mix to combine.</dd>
          <dd>- To steam your milk correctly, pour just enough until it’s right under the spout. Then, aerate (put the tip of steamer right on surface of the milk) for about 4 seconds if you have a powerful steamer, or 8–10 seconds if not. Then lower the steamer so the tip is fully submerged until your cup is too hot to touch. Milk should be the texture of wet paint!</dd>
          <dd>- Lastly, pour the milk over your espresso in a circular motion from about 5 cm above the cup and with the cup tilted. Then lower the spout almost to the surface and level out your cup to attempt some latte art (it takes practice)!</dd>
        </dl>

          <h2>Finally... Some Barista Tips!</h2>

          <h3>Milk Matters</h3>
          <p>The type of milk you choose changes the flavor and texture of your coffee. Whole milk gives creaminess, oat milk is naturally sweet, and 2% is a balanced choice. Learn to steam and froth properly for that café-quality latte foam!</p>

          <h3>Grind & Brew</h3>
          <p>Your coffee grind affects taste. Espresso needs a fine grind, drip coffee medium, and cold brew coarse. Adjusting grind size and brew time can help you avoid bitterness or weak flavor.</p>

          <h3>Temperature Tricks</h3>
          <p>Hot coffee should be brewed between 195–205°F for the best flavor. Cold brew doesn’t use heat, but longer steeping (12–24 hours) extracts smooth sweetness without bitterness.</p>

          <h3>Coffee Storage</h3>
          <p>Keep your beans in an airtight container away from sunlight and moisture. Fresh beans = fresh coffee!</p>
