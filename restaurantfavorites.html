        <h2>Top 5 Madison Restaurant Favorites</h2>
        <p>
          If you've been to Madison before, you know how many amazing restaurant options there are here — and it can be overwhelming! 
          Here are my top 5 eats in Madison (in no particular order):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Estacion Inka</strong>
            <p>
              Estacion Inka is a Peruvian restaurant with a casual vibe, spectacular food, and large portions. 
              My favorite thing to order is the chicken saltado with cilantro rice — it never disappoints.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eno Vino</strong>
            <p>
              Eno Vino is a more upscale restaurant with a stunning view of the Capitol and an amazing atmosphere. 
              They're known for their tapas (small plates to share). My favorites include the chicken kebabs, tortellini, scallops, and cauliflower — 
              their flavor combinations are truly unmatched!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marigold</strong>
            <p>
              Marigold is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Madison. The atmosphere is cozy and charming (expect a line on weekends!). 
              I love the mushroom and gouda omelet or the breakfast burrito — and the breakfast potatoes are incredible. 
              Honorable mention: the coffee is phenomenal!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sardine</strong>
            <p>
              I haven’t been to Sardine too many times, but every visit has been great. It’s right on the water and beautifully designed inside — 
              plus, it’s one of the only French restaurants in Madison. Everything is fresh, simple, and delicious.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lucille</strong>
            <p>
              Lucille is another charming restaurant near the Capitol. It serves creative pizzas and a mix of fusion dishes. 
              My go-to is the Umami Pie — definitely my favorite. And their cheese curds? Amazing.
